Vue assignment - E-wallet
--

**Final commit:** I made some design changes using v-mask which makes input into the form easier. While I am satisfied with the project, I admit there are some more small fixes that would have elevated the project further. If I ever feel inclined I might have a look in the future.

**Fifteenth commit:** Form and functionality is finally in place! I'm taking a break, then rechecking the code before submitting the assignment.

**Fourteenth commit:** I'm still having a bit of problem with adding a new card to the stack, but I've solved the design for the input form.

**Thirteenth commit:** A lot has happened. I managed to add my top card (I was of by this -><- much) and added a function to change the top card by clicking on a card in the stack. Fixing some design elements, then starting out with the card input.

**Twelth commit:** Changed my top and added a button with a routing method to the Add card-page.

**Eleventh commit:** Some steps forward. I'm completely happy with the card designs now and currently working on my home view. I'm mostly trying different things to figure it out, but it's probably time for a break now.

**Tenth commit:** I had a bit of problem with my routing, but sorted it out through changing my paths. Now I'm getting somewhere.

**Ninth commit:** I consider the design elements finished by now. Now I'm moving on to the more functional aspects.

**Eighth commit:** I'm starting to get satisfied with the design elements. I still need to add some bevel effects on the text and get the logos in the right places, but other than than it's starting to get somewhere. After this I'll work with layering the cards and creating a switch function.

**Seventh commit:** Computed props fixed! I missed to write in "else if", so the code had nowhere to go.

**Sixth commit:** Making progress, albeit slowly. I've done a few design elements and managed to put logos in the right places. I also realised that I'm having some issues with my computed props in Card.vue. I unsuccessfully tried to add a props when I noticed that the one who was already there wasn't even working. I removed it and noticed that the page stayed the same, so it probably wasn't necessary. I'm going to keep working on my computed props.

**Fifth commit:** Okay, now I have all the information I need, now comes cleaning the code and starting out with design elements.

**Fourth commit:** I managed to nest my Card component into my CardStack component. Next I'll work on how to include info from my card array.

**Third commit:** Have started to connect the different components. I had some problems with undefined computed data, and founf out if was because I've missed changing a name. Now I'm working on displaying different details.

**Second commit:** Successfully created a routing system. I had some issues because of the routing not being properly installed, but once installed everything seems to work fine.

**First commit on e-wallet assignment.** I have create a new Vue file through Git Bash, next step is to create the different components.
