Vue assignment - E-wallet
--

First commit on e-wallet assignment. I have create a new Vue file through Git Bash, next step is to create the different components.

Second commit: Successfully created a routing system. I had some issues because of the routing not being properly installed, but once installed everything seems to work fine.

Third commit: Have started to connect the different components. I had some problems with undefined computed data, and founf out if was because I've missed changing a name. Now I'm working on displaying different details.

Fourth commit: I managed to nest my Card component into my CardStack component. Next I'll work on how to include info from my card array.

Fifth commit: Okay, now I have all the information I need, now comes cleaning the code and starting out with design elements.
